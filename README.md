Medical image enhancement strategy based on morphologically processing of residuals using a special kernel

This article proposes a competent medical image enhancement method based on morphologically processing of residuals using a special kernel. It combines linear low pass filtering with nonlinear technique that allows for selection of essential regions where edges will get well preserved. The selection of those regions is based on morphological processing of linear filter residuals and then aims to find significant regions specified by edges of high amplitude and appropriate size. The reconstructed regions are combined with the output of low pass filtering to recovers the original shape of edges. In addition, the method allows to control the contrast to avoid blurring while preserving significant image information. In the end, a special kernel is convolved with an image to obtain the sharper image.


RUN the code:

You should download the images in the "database" folder, and add this folder to your project path.
Run "run_Demo.m" and select the image that you want to enhace it.
